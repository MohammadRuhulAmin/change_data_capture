  explain it
```
1. docker run: This command is used to create and start a new Docker container.
2. -it: These options are used to run the container in interactive mode with a terminal attached.
        -i (interactive): Keeps STDIN open even if not attached.
        -t (tty): Allocates a pseudo-TTY (a terminal).
3. --rm: This option automatically removes the container when it exits. This helps to keep your environment clean by not leaving stopped containers around.

4. --name zookeeper: This sets the name of the container to "zookeeper". This is useful for referencing the container later.

5. -p 2181:2181 -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888: These options map the container's ports to the host machine's ports.
        -p 2181:2181: Maps port 2181 of the container to port 2181 of the host machine. Port 2181 is typically used for client connections.
        -p 2888:2888: Maps port 2888 of the container to port 2888 of the host machine. Port 2888 is used for follower connections.
        -p 3888:3888: Maps port 3888 of the container to port 3888 of the host machine. Port 3888 is used for leader election.

6. quay.io/debezium/zookeeper:2.5: This specifies the Docker image to use and its version. Here, the image is hosted on Quay.io in the debezium repository, and the tag (version) is 2.5. This image contains Zookeeper, which is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

### More on ports:

- -p 2181:2181: This port is used for client connections.
        Zookeeper's Port 2181: This is the default port on which Zookeeper listens for client connections. Clients (such as Kafka brokers or other applications) connect to this port to interact with the Zookeeper service.

- -p 2888:2888: This port is used for communication between Zookeeper nodes in a Zookeeper ensemble.
        Zookeeper's Port 2888: This port is used for follower connections to the leader. When you have a Zookeeper ensemble (a cluster of Zookeeper servers), the follower nodes connect to the leader node on this port to synchronize data and follow the leader.

- -p 3888:3888: This port is used for leader election.
        Zookeeper's Port 3888: This port is used during the leader election process. When a leader needs to be elected (e.g., when the current leader fails), the nodes communicate on this port to hold an election and determine the new leader.

In essence:

- Port 2181: Client connections (for interacting with Zookeeper).
- Port 2888: Follower connections to the leader (for synchronizing data in a cluster).
- Port 3888: Leader election (for deciding the new leader in case of failure).


In summary, this command starts a Zookeeper container in interactive mode with a terminal, removes the container upon exit, names the container "zookeeper," maps the necessary ports, and uses the Zookeeper image version 2.5 from Quay.io.
