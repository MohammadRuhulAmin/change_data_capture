  explain it
```
1. docker run: This command is used to create and start a new Docker container.
2. -it: These options are used to run the container in interactive mode with a terminal attached.
        -i (interactive): Keeps STDIN open even if not attached.
        -t (tty): Allocates a pseudo-TTY (a terminal).
3. --rm: This option automatically removes the container when it exits. This helps to keep your environment clean by not leaving stopped containers around.

4. --name zookeeper: This sets the name of the container to "zookeeper". This is useful for referencing the container later.

5. -p 2181:2181 -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888: These options map the container's ports to the host machine's ports.
        -p 2181:2181: Maps port 2181 of the container to port 2181 of the host machine. Port 2181 is typically used for client connections.
        -p 2888:2888: Maps port 2888 of the container to port 2888 of the host machine. Port 2888 is used for follower connections.
        -p 3888:3888: Maps port 3888 of the container to port 3888 of the host machine. Port 3888 is used for leader election.

6. quay.io/debezium/zookeeper:2.5: This specifies the Docker image to use and its version. Here, the image is hosted on Quay.io in the debezium repository, and the tag (version) is 2.5. This image contains Zookeeper, which is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.


In summary, this command starts a Zookeeper container in interactive mode with a terminal, removes the container upon exit, names the container "zookeeper," maps the necessary ports, and uses the Zookeeper image version 2.5 from Quay.io.
